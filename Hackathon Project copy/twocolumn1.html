								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pics100.png" alt=""></a></p>
								<p> Both Ritti Bhogal and Vruti Soni attend Downigntown STEM Academy where they soon became friends. Through sharing similar interests, Ritti decided to create a AI club where we are able to show the student in our schools the importance of AI and how it will be use in the 
									future and involved Vruti in the making of the club. Currently Ritti, founder and president, and Vruti, vice president, have been outreaching into different program such as Hackathons and conferences to be more exposed to the careers that might be involved in the future.
									The club is expanding steadily with people finding it more entertaining to join and we have partnered with Lockheed Martin, Evolve IP, and SWE. Both Ritti and Vruti are both seniors and in the process of applying to colleges and found that the research process of colleges 
									can be very tedious and time consuming. Especially through this pandemic, it has become extremely difficult to understand the college environment. We found a website that is able to gather the research of these colleges, their lifestyle, virtual tours dates, and even reviews
									 of these colleges from other students which in the end helps the student apply. This website makes it a place where the students are able to find and pick their perfect colleges to apply with the research available all in one site. Therefore, through reaching this Hackathon 
									 from AI club, Ritti and Vruti were able to create a website as a solution to problems/stresses when applying and choosing colleges to apply to.
