Division Delta submission Vruti Soni and Sukhleen Bhogal

Both Ritti and Vruti are seniors and in the process of applying to colleges. They found that the research process of colleges can be very tedious and time consuming. Especially during this pandemic, it has become extremely difficult to understand the college environment, let alone enter it. We founded a website that is able to gather the research of these colleges, their lifestyle, virtual tours dates, and even reviews of these colleges from other students which in the end helps the student apply. We call it College Spark! This website makes it a place where the students are able to find and pick their perfect colleges to apply with the research available all in one site. Therefore, through reaching this Hackathon from AI club, Ritti and Vruti were able to create College Spark as a solution to the stresses caused by trying to figure out which college is right for not just them, but their fellow seniors!
